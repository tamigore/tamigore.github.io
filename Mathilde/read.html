					<h3 id="bubble">Bubble shop</h3>
					<p><em>1.</em>My best friend, Marine, owns a bubble shop next to the main square - or circle, rather. 
						Her bubbles are strong, big and made by a small box fan that blows through a circle of strings 
						dipped into soapy water at regular intervals. You can have a plain bubble if you are like. I never 
						have a plain bubble. I ask Marine to fill mine up with the trembling voice of Barbara. Unfortunately 
						for my cousin Nils, who I brought to the store one summer day last night, the bubbles aren’t thick 
						enough to contain the high-pitched notes of Die Zauberflote. He left the store disappointed, in his 
						silent bubble, which we shared, for they are very resistant to laughter, these bubbles. </p>

					<h3 id="gallery">Art gallery</h3>
					<p><em>2.</em>This art gallery is located next to a vintage underwear store. You have to enter it through 
						a neighboring street that runs parallel to rue Ronde. I didn’t  know I would end up on rue Ronde 
						at all as my mother and I wandered through Brooklyn and happened upon the place. The open wooden 
						door led to a rather steep slope covered in blue and pink balloons floating near the ground all 
						the way to a large opening on the other side. The balloons did not slide down the slope or spill 
						onto the rue. There were lamps on the walls made from slightly flattened pink and blue balloons 
						arranged into bouquets of two or three. We liked those. My mom and I detached one of the lamps from 
						the wall to take it home, while the artist, dressed in a dark blue tailcoat and top hat, talked to 
						someone wearing yellow overalls and a big orange afro just outside the shop. Once we got the lamp, 
						we started carefully descending the slope, holding the lamp tight against our stomachs so the 
						artists wouldn’t see it. As we enjoyed the strange sensation of the balloons under our feet, 
						we felt the artist rushing behind us and started hurrying ourselves. Tripping on the balloons, 
						we hurtled down the slope, rolling on the ground. We reached the bottom of the slope, deliciously 
						dizzy. As I pulled myself up from the balloons, I put on my most candid smile and saw the artist’s 
						frown disappear as her eyes met mine. She sighed resignedly and climbed back up the slope without 
						a word. The lamps had popped in our fall anyways. As my mom and I walked away on rue Ronde, I noticed 
						animated postcards on the walls of angry bears screaming “It’s mine!” and “This is mine!”.</p>

					<h3 id="church">Twin churches</h3>
					<p><em>3.</em>The church has an identical twin. In front of the two churches, an old lady sells flowers 
						from one of the book stands they usually sell books from by the Seine. As I walked by, a man 
						blasted a song I liked from his car, so I danced on the sidewalk. The old lady joined in and 
						the way she danced was very funny. She sang jokes in a rocky voice, which she ended by ringing 
						the bell she held in her left hand with the stick in her right. I decided to buy a bouquet of 
						big yellow flowers and smaller pink flowers from her. I didn’t want them to be too old, that way 
						they would have time to bloom, but I ended up with a bouquet of buds. She took me to the anarchist 
						theater held by her son and his wife. It’s right around the corner. We went up a flight of stairs 
						and found an adorable family of four sitting on two couches facing each other. I looked at flyers 
						for the anarchist plays. The youngest boy looked at me with his big grey eyes. He said he recognized 
						me from that time I brought a red rose to a guy I liked at the theater. I pretended I didn’t know 
						what he was talking about.</p>

					<h3 id="saloon">Saloon</h3>
					<p><em>4.</em>At number 7, there is a huge saloon where real cactuses grow from the hardwood floor. 
						All the guys there have mustaches, even the guy I used to love who is playing folk music 
						on our old couch between two spiky plants. His folk features singers who sit on his lap. 
						His guitar student Jimmy is singing now. Jimmy was born on a mountain and has never seen 
						the sea. He’s a little bit of a mama’s boy, and he mumbles melodies about his mama and the 
						sea. The sweet sea. He doesn’t know it’s salty. I tell him and he doesn’t believe me. His 
						mama smiles. She wears a blue bikini. She is excited for him to discover the sea and the 
						things beyond it, even though it sounds a little scary to Jimmy. They talk about floating 
						on their backs to other countries. He doesn’t know it’s far. He imagines the sea to be a 
						sweet still pool with floating fishies. I tell him about the waves and he looks at me like 
						I'm pulling his leg. What kind of organism could to and fro like that tirelessly?

					<h3 id="subway">Subway</h3>
					<p><em>5.</em>There is a subway with three stops underneath rue Ronde. Two of the stations are painted 
						blue, but the third one is orange. The counter to buy your ticket is on the wrong side of 
						the turnstiles. I can see ticket inspectors in their blue outfits standing by the platform, 
						lazily checking passengers’ tickets. I wait there for a while, not knowing what to do, worried 
						they might notice me hesitating. Finally, I crawl under the turnstiles and stand in line to get 
						my ticket. By the time I get the ticket, the inspectors are gone, so I don’t bother going back 
						out and through the turnstiles, I just get on the train with my unused ticket.

					<h3 id="office">Uncle's office</h3>
					<p><em>6.</em>My uncle’s office is an open space where the cubicles are made of public library 
						shelves that store mostly children's books. He is a writer. Everybody is busy, talking on the 
						phone, searching the Internet. My dad, mom, and I are visiting him and he is proud to show us 
						his desk and his old grey computer. The patio outside however is very gloomy. There is one dry 
						tree growing from a whole in the concrete, and some trash cans. There are a couple of lonely 
						looking graffitis. And rats. Big, fast rats on pigeon legs. One of the rats starts running 
						after me, it wants to bite into my big toe. I try to kill it with a trash can lid, but I am 
						too slow and he corners me against a wall. Nobody knows what to do, until a tall figure 
						wearing a dark hood runs towards me and kills the rat with a scythe made of pieces of public 
						library shelves, and then disappears.</p>

					<h3 id="office">Boat pier</h3>
					<p><em>8.</em>I’m not sure how Sofiane, Emre and I got from Place de la Concorde to the rivière 
						Ronde. The river runs in a circle and you never know how long it will take you to get back 
						around to where you started. It was morning and we were still pretty tipsy. We were lucky to 
						get there when we did because there was a small boat moored to the stone quay, pulsating with 
						morning house music, ready to leave. A small Staline-looking man held a dirty string open with 
						his  pudgy fingers, to let us through. He handed us yellow tickets and said something grumpy 
						in Turkish. We stood there, confused, even though Emre speaks Turkish, but the man was already 
						looking away, so we stepped onto the boat, where a few high people were dancing. We danced for 
						a while as the boat made its tranquil way through a bright green pine forest, and the sun rose 
						until 11 a.m. The Staline-looking Turkish man put on an apron and served us stacks of pancakes 
						covered in a gooey pink sauce on cardboard plates. He sat down with us in a plastic chair 
						around a plastic table and said more grumpy things about being tired and wanting to go home. 
						We offered him some pancakes but he didn’t want any.</p>

					<h3 id="river">River branches out</h3>
					<p><em>9.</em>There is a place where the river branches out into two streams and one becomes 
						shallow, almost a brook, and passes over the other, like a river highway exit. I was standing 
						in the higher stream and my friends were standing in the stream below. The water barely 
						reached my chins. We were fishing for a rare octopus, called the Tiger Octopus, with big 
						landing nets. They had done this before but it was my first time. I was very focused, 
						looking carefully for movement amongst the rocks, when I felt something slimy between my 
						toes and saw two grey eyes peeping at me from between my feet. I immediately placed the net 
						in the octopus’ way and watched it get caught slowly. We were all very excited. It was 
						beautiful, too, the colorful dots on its back and tentacles dancing in the net. I was allowed 
						to keep one octopus, but I set it free anyway.</p>

					<h3 id="ikea">Ikea</h3>
					<p><em>10.</em>There is also an IKEA. You have to wait in line through the night to get in. They 
						give you blue anti-contamination suits and plastic covers for your shoes which you put on in 
						a locker room before entering. Then you have to grab and drag a string dangling from a single 
						rail in the ceiling. The strings are dirty and have a red sprinkler head attached to the end 
						of them, which makes them hard to hold on to, but I got one of the older ones from which the 
						sprinkler had fallen off. You have to run and jump through all the different rooms. Sometimes, 
						when you run, you get pulled forward by the motion of the string you were dragging behind you 
						a second ago. In one of the rooms, there was a black chalkboard on which a Russian girl and I 
						drew a big orange tree. She thought the tree was so pretty that she kissed me. Then we had to 
						run out because the IKEA was closing.

					<h3 id="loft">Loft</h3>
					<p><em>11.</em>I lived in a loft with a river that ran through two of the rooms, but mostly mine. 
						It ran like a rapid in the far corner of my bedroom and served as a trashcan and a jacuzzi. 
						We built a dam with white tree branches in my roommate Joe’s room so the trash wouldn’t 
						pollute the rest of the stream, but Joe wouldn’t clean it. He didn’t seem to mind the empty 
						cans and wrappers stuck to his naked butt when he sat in and felt the pressure of the cool 
						water. The water started slowly rising and pouring out of the garage next door.

					<h3 id="basement">Basement</h3>
					<p><em>12.</em>In the basement lives a Native American man. He wears a black Akubra hat and a 
						long black coat. His black hair is braided in a single thick and shiny braid that falls down 
						his back all the way to his knees. He is friendly. I stayed in a room in his apartment one 
						night. The apartment was minimalistic and bright. There was a simple wooden cross on the wall 
						facing my bed. I woke up at sunrise and stepped out onto the cool white tile of the kitchen 
						to get some water. I saw him sitting on his bed through the open door to his room. I invited 
						him into his kitchen. He didn’t want any water. We looked good in the morning light. We 
						watched through the long, horizontal window above the sink as a little girl ran by. She was 
						waving a long, pastel ribbon that flew behind her. He told me she was coming back from a 
						rave on top of a rock.
